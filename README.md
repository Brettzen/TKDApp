# TKDApp
Web-App for a martial arts school. This web-app is designed to give students an extra source for practicing their specific belt's curriculum. This will enable the student to have more resources to practice while away from the dojang.

This is being built using AngularJS with Angular Material. Bower is the project's packaging system.
